Readme: FullStack Course - Project Two: Games Website

Welcome to the second project in the FullStack course! This project involves building a games website that includes two games: Snake and a Trivia Quiz. The website requires user identification as an existing user, and new users can also register. The website stores information about various users, including logins, times, activities, achievements, etc. All data is saved in the browser's Local Storage, and there is no server or database involved.
